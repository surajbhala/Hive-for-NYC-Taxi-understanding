# Hive-for-NYC-Taxi-understanding
Using Hive to get a better understanding of the taxi system so that the city of New York can improve the efficiency of in-city commutes.
The New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) has provided a dataset of trips made by the taxis in the New York City. The detailed trip-level data is more than just a vast list of taxi pickup and drop off coordinates.  
The records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations (location coordinates of the starting and ending points), trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, driver-reported passenger counts etc. The data used was collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) by technology providers authorized under the Taxicab & Livery Passenger Enhancement Programs (TPEP/LPEP). 
We have to identify trends in data like if the number of trips are more on a festival or holiday , do group of people pay more tips than indiviuals , what is the average speed of the vehicle on normal vs special days , correlations between variables, preferred mode of payment and how we can generate more revenue by giving some offers for the preferred mode of payment ,etc.
